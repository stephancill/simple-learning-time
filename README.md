# simple-learning-time
An educational mobile application for reading of analogue and digital time.

## Feature List
* Interactive hour and minute pointers.
* Hour pointer is updated in real-time as minutes change.
* Digital time that updates in real-time as changes are made on the clock.


## Included in this project:
* Visual assets for clock elements (clock face, hour hand, minute hand, center circle)
* Visual assets for other elements (scene background, digits for digital time)
* Implementation of ClockManager that instantiates clock elements
* Implementation of DigitalTimeManager that instantiates a set of 4 sprites that each display a digit of the current time
* Code that rotates movable clock elements (hour and minute) and sets digital time


## To-do:
- [ ] Add moving background (according to time)
- [ ] Set anologue time by digital time



## Known issues:
- [ ] The app is limited to landscape mode only due to inconsistent pixel coordinates.
